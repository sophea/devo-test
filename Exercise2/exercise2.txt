EXERCISE 2

Given 3 data sets, you are required to create a web page that can read the 3 data sources through
ajax, and displays 2 highcharts graphs, a line graph with date on X-axis with as many series as categories,
and a pie chart per category, grouping the total data (sum of values by each category).
The sources have temporary information ; a date, category and a value. The series must be combined
in a way that if there is data in more than one series for a same date and category, these will be added.
The categories must be normalized in order to have them all in capital letters, “Cat 1” and “cat 1” are
equivalent to “CAT 1”

Series 1 contains data in the following format :
{"d":1435708800000,"cat":"Cat 1","value":832.803815816826}
d is the date in milliseconds, cat is the category and value is the value that is available in
http://s3.amazonaws.com/logtrust-static/test/test/data1.json
Series 2 contains data in the following format :
{"myDate":"2015-06-02","categ":"CAT 1","val":46.300059172697175}
mydate is the date in YYYY-MM-DD format, categ is the category and val is the the value that is
available in http://s3.amazonaws.com/logtrust-static/test/test/data2.json

Series 3 contains data in the following format :
{"raw":"9OHbc9 O1 WHTxiBPa auwZIVD6 j8jMWWVH UdB6hy 2015-06-18 XF 5xhcx15DD sbYFRPn
dyoH1OOIF 6meHw pANknwa2h T imhs24gR5 #cat 1#","val":39.38690127513058}
raw contains data in raw with words, the date with YYYY-MM-DD format and the category between #,
a processing of the raw should be performed to obtain the date and category. Val is the value. In the
example, the date would be 2015-06-18 and the normalized category CAT 1. It is available in
http://s3.amazonaws.com/logtrust-static/test/test/data3.json
The use of libraries for problem solving is permitted.
The line graph should be similar to the below image but using the corresponding data and categories
of the provided data
