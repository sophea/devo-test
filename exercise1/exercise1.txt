EXERCISE 1
Create a function in python that can indicate if each number from a provided list of numbers, is a
perfect, abundant, or defective number.
• A perfect number is one that is equal to the sum of its positive proper divisors, excluding itself. For
example 6 = 1+2+3
• An abundant number is one in which the sum of the proper divisors is greater than the number.
• A defective number is one in which the sum of the proper divisors is less than the number.
Please use Python 3.5 or higher. The use of external libraries that obtain number classification is not
permitted
