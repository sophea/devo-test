EXERCISE 1
Create a function in python that can indicate if each number from a provided list of numbers, is a
perfect, abundant, or defective number.
• A perfect number is one that is equal to the sum of its positive proper divisors, excluding itself. For
example 6 = 1+2+3
• An abundant number is one in which the sum of the proper divisors is greater than the number.
• A defective number is one in which the sum of the proper divisors is less than the number.
Please use Python 3.5 or higher. The use of external libraries that obtain number classification is not
permitted

###
## call from command line
#: python3 index.py classify 6
python3 index.py classify 6
sum divisors from 6 value is 6
6 is perfect number

$python3 index.py classify 28
sum divisors from 28 value is 28
28 is perfect number

$ python3 index.py classify 12
sum divisors from 12 value is 16
12 is abundant number

$python3 index.py classify 121
sum divisors from 121 value is 12
121 is deficient number
